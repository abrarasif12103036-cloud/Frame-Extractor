# What this app does (like I'm 5)

- A video is like a flipbook. Each tiny slice of time is a page.
- You give the app a video (you upload it).
- The app takes a picture every 0.1 seconds (that's 10 pictures every second).
- You get all those pictures back as files (or a ZIP) so you can look at every moment.

Why this is useful:
- Make thumbnails, analyze motion, or just see every little step in a video.

How it works (very simply):
- You upload → server runs a tool called `ffmpeg` to make pictures → server zips the pictures and gives them back to you.

If you'd like, I can show you each file and how to run it on your computer.
